# What is it? #
  1. Press `Ctrl-C` to copy or `Ctrl-X` to cut the whole line in an editor **if you select nothing**. (It works as usual if you select some text.)
  1. Put the caret on any line on any position.
  1. Press `Ctrl-V` to paste the line above. (You will not lose the caret position.)

Works on Windows and Linux.
Should work on Mac but not tested.
Tested on Eclipse 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 on Java 6.
